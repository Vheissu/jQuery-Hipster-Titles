jQuery-Hipster-Titles
=====================

Don't truncate potentially useful information in your titles and page headings with the standard ellipsis. Long titles will be truncated and when you hover them the rest of the text will be revealed to the user with a marquee like effect.

See the plugin in action <a href="http://vheissu.github.io/jQuery-Hipster-Titles/">here</a>.
